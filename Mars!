          <p>It is <em>inevitable</em> that we, an intricate species who are filled with curiousity everyday of our lives, will soon visit -with relief
            yet copious amount of nervousness- the undefiled soil of our next door neighbor lingering in space.
            That neighbor is Mars. <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">Nasa,</abbr> on the other hand,
            is on a mission to reach Mars on February 18, 2021.</p>

        <h3>What We Should Do</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>As with every other space exploration mission orchestrated, plans to reduce risks as efficient as possible is needed.</li>
          <li>As mentioned in the source provided, "affordable human exploration of Mars" is required to help provide for technology and human health included.</li>
          <li>Have realistic approaches. This is palpable but to many, exploring Mars seems like a science fiction outlook sprinkled with some reality, but this requires an abunance of realistic outcomes.</li>
