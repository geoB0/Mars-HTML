# Mars-HTML

A short article on Mars exploration. 
I've utilized various HTML elements and made sure I provided some semantic and non-semantic elements so I can consistently get better and learn new elements.

Due to mainly learning C++ at the moment because this is the language that my school teach/lecture the most, I am currently having fun with learning new HTML.

I did not use CSS in this little work of mine because I haven't used CSS in a while. 
I rather have an efficient outcome than to just throw in what I "think" I know and have it really messy!
